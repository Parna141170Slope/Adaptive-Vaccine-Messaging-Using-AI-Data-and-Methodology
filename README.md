Adaptive Vaccine Messaging Using AI 
A pilot evaluation was conducted in January 2025 to assess Reddit API data collection, resulting in the creation of a sample dataset. The methodology for the snapshot data collection first included identifying a list of keywords related to vaccines and immunization. Data were then collected from Reddit subreddits (e.g. r/CanadaCoronavirus) by using the Python Reddit API Wrapper library. Included in the analysis were posts between March 10, 2020, as community transmission of COVID-19 was increasing steadily in Canada, and January 13, 2025. Top-level comments were extracted based on keyword matches, including nested comments up to a depth of two. Data were processed in segments to avoid overloading the system and then cleaned to remove duplicates. Comments with fewer than 10 characters were excluded to ensure meaningful content. The dataset includes metadata such as subreddit name, post title, comment text, date, score, keyword (used to flag the comment for API retrieval), and comment depth. The “score” category represents the net difference between upvotes and downvotes on a post, as calculated by Reddit at the time of collection.
